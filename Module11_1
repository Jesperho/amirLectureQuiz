#Implement the following class hierarchy using Python: A publication can be either a book or a magazine.
# Each publication has a name. Each book also has an author and a page count, whereas each magazine has a
# chief editor. Also write the required initializers to both classes. Create a print_information method to
# both subclasses for printing out all information of the publication in question. In the main program,
# create publications Donald Duck (chief editor Aki Hyyppä) and Compartment No. 6 (author Rosa Liksom, 192 pages).
# Print out all information of both publications using the methods you implemented.
