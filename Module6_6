#Write a function that receives two parameters:
# the diameter of a round pizza in centimeters and the price of the pizza in euros.
# The function calculates and returns the unit price of the pizza per square meter.
# The main program asks the user to enter the diameter and price of two pizzas and tells the user which pizza provides
# better value for money (which of them has a lower unit price).
# You must use the function you wrote for calculating the unit prices.
